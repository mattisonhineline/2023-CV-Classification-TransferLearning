# 2023-Music-Generator
Development process of making a music generator


This is a new repository which is a personal project in process. 

  1. Collect a large dataset of songs from many genres
  2. Preprocess the data to extract features such as rhythm patterns, chord progressions, and melody patterns.
  3. Train a deep learning model, such as a GAN, on this data to learn the patterns and structures of the genres.
  4. Use the trained model to generate a new song by sampling from the learned distributions of musical elements.
  5. Fine-tune the generated song by adjusting elements such as tempo, instrumentation, and melody to create a unique and coherent    composition.
